Tagged v2.9 is the final version before the major changes. In  the new update these are the major changes

1. pymorph.py is broken into small functions and they are grouped into the module pymorphutils.py
2. The pyraf dependency becomes optional now.
3. In the absence of pyraf it generates the 1d profiles using FitEllipseManual function in pymorphutils.py
4. ndimage depedency is removed completely
5. Now the rotation of images is done using the function rotate in the rotate.py module. It is written based on the numerical reciepe.
6. rotate_new.py becomes rotate_deprecated.py, _ni_support.py becomes _ni_support.py.deprecated
7. asymfunc.py is modified based on the new rotate function. The old module is now asymfunc.py.deprecated. asymfunc.py.deprecated_test.py is nothing but the old module with two additional line to test it. run that using 'python asymfunc.py.deprecated_test.py'
8. In plotfunc.py the magnitude difference in profiles are found using interpolation function. It is better than old method
9. Some other modules are cleaned up.
10. convolve module dependency is removed completely. Now it is using the own function for convolution.
11. Added the capability of reading galfit3 output format. 
12. All the CASGM modules are cleaned up
